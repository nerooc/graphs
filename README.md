# Graphs

A repository devoted to graphs, their representations and related algorithms.

## How to use the program:

1. Install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt. (taurus command `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)

2. Sample data (Adjacency matrix, Adjacency list and Incidence matrix) are included in files in the _"InputFiles"_ directory. (Sample graphs are included in .txt files in this directory). However, user can specify the path to the input file that isn't necessarily in this directory (user can specify path with second argument of the program. For example:
`python3 task2.py InputFiles/input_a.txt`)

3. Run the program with command `python3 task_.py` where `_` is the number of the task (for example: `python3 task1.py`).
