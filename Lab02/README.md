## Task 1 - Degree Sequence

The program allows user to check whether given sequence is a degree sequence (representing graph).

## Task 2 - Graph randomization

The program allows user to randomise graph without changing vertices degrees.

## Task 3 - Graph components

The program allows user to find all components in given degree sequence representing graph.

## Task 4 - Eulerian cycle

The program allows user to find and display Eulerian cycle in a randomly generated Eulerian graph.

## Task 5 - *k*-regular Graph Generator

The program allows user to generate random *k*-regular graph.

## Task 6 - Hamiltonian Cycle

The program allows user to check if a graph from a file is Hamiltonian and if it is, the program finds and displays the Hamiltonian cycle.
