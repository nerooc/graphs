## Task 2 - Graph randomization

The program allows user to randomise graph without changing vertices degrees

## Task 4 - Eulerian cycle

The program allows user to find and display Eulerian cycle in a randomly generated Eulerian graph.

## Task 6 - Hamiltonian Cycle

The program allows user to check if a graph from a file is Hamiltonian and if it is, the program finds and displays the Hamiltonian cycle.
