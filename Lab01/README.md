## Task 1 - Graph decoder

First task revolves around different graph representations and their connection between each other. The program allows the user to convert a graph from a file to the other forms.

The representations have to meet some requirements.

### Requirements for Adjacency matrix input file:

1. File should contain only rows with matrix (no enters before matrix and after).
2. Numbers should be separated with space.

Example:

0 1 1 <- first line

1 0 0

1 0 0 <- last line

### Requirements for Adjacency list input file:

1. List should be bulleted without dots.
2. File should contain only rows with matrix (no enters before matrix and after).
3. Numbers should be separaded with spaces.

Example:

1 2 3 <- first line

2 1

3 1 <- last line

### Requirements for Incidence matrix input file:

1. File should contain only rows with matrix (no enters before matrix and after).
2. Numbers should be separaded with space.

Example:

1 1 <- first line

1 0

0 1 <- last line

## Task 2 - Graph drawer

Program allows the user to draw/plot a graph based on any representation. The vertices of the graph are evenly distributed around a circle.

## Task 3 - Graph generator

Program provides a way for an optimized graph generation based on a few variables [...].
